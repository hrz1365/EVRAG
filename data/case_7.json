    "model_output": "Managed charging is a strategy where the delivery of power to groups of vehicles connected to the grid for long periods of time is delayed to coincide with off-peak hours.",

    "Answer Relevancy_score": "1.000",
    "Answer Relevancy_reason": "The score is 1.00 because there were no irrelevant statements, indicating perfect alignment with the input question! Great job!",
    "Faithfulness_score": "1.000",
    "Faithfulness_reason": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the retrieval context and the actual output! Great job!",
    "Contextual Precision_score": "1.000",
    "Contextual Precision_reason": "The score is 1.00 because all the relevant nodes are ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. The first node directly answers the question. The second node, while related to charging, only mentions that 'managed charging offers more limited value' in the context of highway charging. The third node describes the ML model used to infer charging events based on factors like 'traffic, demographics, competition, time of day', but doesn't explain the strategy.",
    "Factual Correctness [GEval]_score": "0.700",
    "Factual Correctness [GEval]_reason": "The actual output omits the important detail that managed charging is a 'critical' strategy and the example of 'fleet depots'. These omissions lower the score.",
    "Semantic Similarity [GEval]_score": "1.000",
    "Semantic Similarity [GEval]_reason": "The actual output and expected output express the same meaning. The actual output is a more concise version of the expected output, but it does not introduce any incorrect or contradictory information. The actual output also does not omit any critical information."
