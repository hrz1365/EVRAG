    "input": "What are the benefits of proactive investment to future-proof sites?",
    "model_output": "Proactive investment to future-proof sites can reduce the need for duplicative investments, minimize grid infrastructure costs to site owners (and reduce costs to drivers), and allow for faster and efficient charging installations.",

    "Answer Relevancy_score": "1.000",
    "Answer Relevancy_reason": "The score is 1.00 because there were no irrelevant statements, indicating perfect alignment with the prompt! Keep up the great work!",
    "Faithfulness_score": "1.000",
    "Faithfulness_reason": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the retrieval context and the actual output! Great job!",
    "Contextual Precision_score": "1.000",
    "Contextual Precision_reason": "The score is 1.00 because all the relevant nodes are ranked higher than any irrelevant nodes. The first node directly answers the question by stating that 'Proactive investment to future-proof sites can reduce the need for duplicative investments, minimize grid infrastructure costs to site owners... and allow for faster and efficient charging installations.', the second node supports the expected output by mentioning that 'we can avoid duplicative investments, reduce total costs, and future-proof high-traffic sites for accelerated charging deployment.', and the third node discusses avoiding 'stranded costs' and the need to plan for 'expected charging demand' which relates to the benefits of proactive investment.",
    "Factual Correctness [GEval]_score": "1.000",
    "Factual Correctness [GEval]_reason": "The actual output contains all the information in the expected output and does not contradict any facts. It also includes additional context that is beneficial.",
    "Semantic Similarity [GEval]_score": "1.000",
    "Semantic Similarity [GEval]_reason": "The actual output and expected output express the same meaning. The actual output adds context ('Proactive investment to future-proof sites can') and clarifies the cost reduction ('and reduce costs to drivers'), but these additions do not introduce incorrect or contradictory information. Therefore, the outputs are semantically equivalent."
