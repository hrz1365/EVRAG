    "Contextual Precision_reason": "The score is 0.50 because the first node in the retrieval contexts, which states that the document \"discusses the long timelines for grid infrastructure upgrades but does not directly answer how many years are necessary\", is not relevant, while the second node, which states that \"These interconnection upgrades can incur substantial cost and take 4-8 years to complete\", is relevant. The irrelevant node is ranked higher than the relevant node.",
