    "Answer Relevancy_reason": "The score is 1.00 because there are no irrelevant statements, indicating perfect alignment with the input question! Great job!",

    "Faithfulness_reason": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context! Great job!",
    "Contextual Precision_score": "1.000",
    "Contextual Precision_reason": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval system ranked all relevant nodes higher than irrelevant nodes. Specifically, the first node states 'A typical highway site will eventually need 20+ fast-chargers to serve expected traffic' and the second node states 'A typical highway site will eventually need 20+ fast-chargers to meet drivers\u2019 needs.', while the third node, which discusses charging infrastructure deployment, does not provide a specific number of chargers, and is therefore ranked last. Great job!",
    "Factual Correctness [GEval]_score": "1.000",
    "Factual Correctness [GEval]_reason": "The actual output '20+ fast-chargers' aligns with the expected output '20+'. The addition of 'fast-chargers' is not a factual contradiction or omission of important details.",
    "Semantic Similarity [GEval]_score": "1.000",
    "Semantic Similarity [GEval]_reason": "The actual output includes 'fast-chargers' which is a harmless clarification that does not change the meaning of '20+'. Therefore, the outputs express the same meaning."
