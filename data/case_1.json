The first node mentions \"Peak Demand\" but doesn't provide information about the equivalence of a 40 MW peak demand. The second node does not provide any information about the equivalence of a 40 MW peak demand. The third node mentions \"peak demand\" but it does not explicitly state the equivalence of a 40 MW peak demand.",

    "Factual Correctness [GEval]_reason": "The actual output states that it cannot answer the question, while the expected output provides a specific answer ('A major industrial site'). This is a direct contradiction and omission of the expected answer, indicating a lack of factual accuracy.",

These outputs do not express the same meaning, and the actual output does not provide a valid answer based on the expected output."
