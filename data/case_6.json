    "input": "Did this study acount for campetitive charging in MHDV assessment and what would be its effect?",
    "model_output": "No, the MHDV assessment did not account for competitive charging. An increase in MHDV competitive charging would reduce demand at candidate sites.",
    "ground_truth": "No. An increase in MHDV\ncompetitive charging would reduce demand at candidate sites.",
    "Answer Relevancy_score": "1.000",
    "Answer Relevancy_reason": "The score is 1.00 because there were no irrelevant statements, indicating perfect alignment with the input question!",
    "Faithfulness_score": "1.000",
    "Faithfulness_reason": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the retrieval context and the actual output! Great job!",
    "Contextual Precision_score": "0.500",
    "Contextual Precision_reason": "The score is 0.50 because the first node in the retrieval contexts, which states that 'This document describes the methodology used in the MHDV assessment, focusing on how load curves were derived. It does not directly address whether \\'competitive charging\\' was accounted for or its potential effects.', is not relevant but ranked higher than the second node, which directly answers the question. However, the third node, which states that 'This document discusses the results of the MHDV assessment, focusing on load curves and capacity requirements for different charger configurations. It does not address whether \\'competitive charging\\' was accounted for or its potential effects.', is also not relevant and ranked lower than the second node.",
    "Factual Correctness [GEval]_score": "1.000",
    "Factual Correctness [GEval]_reason": "The actual output and expected output are factually aligned. The actual output provides the same information as the expected output, answering 'No' and stating that increased competitive charging would reduce demand. There are no contradictions or omissions.",
    "Semantic Similarity [GEval]_score": "1.000",
    "Semantic Similarity [GEval]_reason": "The actual output and expected output express the same meaning. The actual output adds the clarification that the MHDV assessment did not account for competitive charging, which does not contradict the expected output. Therefore, the outputs are semantically equivalent."
